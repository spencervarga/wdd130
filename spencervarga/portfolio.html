            <p>
                My wife and I were able to use our work experience to help kickstart a new soda business named HipSip.
                This endeavor allowed us to challenge ourselves and create a unique and refreshing product that resonates with our customers.
                The challenges we faced and the successes we achieved in launching HipSip have been instrumental in shaping my professional journey.
